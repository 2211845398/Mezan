# MEZAN — Project state

**MEZAN** is a cloud-ready ERP and retail backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, PostgreSQL, Alembic, Docker, `uv`. Architecture: `api/v1` (routes), `services` (logic), `models` (ORM), `schemas` (Pydantic).

## Gaps & technical debt

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| **SSO** | FR mentions SSO; verify and implement OIDC/SAML when required |
| **Loyalty vs GL** | Loyalty points are not a balance-sheet liability unless explicitly modeled and posted |
| **FIFO / LIFO** | Only weighted-average + standard cost; no cost layers |
| **Multi-currency GL** | Currencies + supplier currency exist; no FX revaluation or translated statements |
| **Cash flow statement** | Not built as a dedicated report (balance sheet + income statement APIs exist) |
